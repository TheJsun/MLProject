LGA Offences DatasetThis dataset provides a breakdown of offences reported in Victoria across different Local Government Areas (LGAs), Police Regions, and specific crime types. The dataset is divided into six tables, which include detailed information on crime rates, offence types, investigation statuses, and drug-related crimes. The data is compiled from the Crime Statistics Agency (CSA) of Victoria and is used to support local and state authorities in crime analysis and law enforcement strategies.Definitions1. Crime Definitions: The classifications for offence types are based on the CSA's standard categories. Offence divisions, subdivisions, and subgroups are used to group and specify the nature of crimes (e.g., property crime, crimes against the person).2. Rate Calculation: Crime rates are calculated based on the number of offences per 100,000 population for each LGA or Police Service Area. These rates are standardized to allow comparison between regions of different population sizes.3. Investigation Status: Offence investigation statuses include cases that are pending, solved, or closed without resolution. Cases marked as ‘solved’ indicate that an offender has been identified or charged.4. Drug Offences: Drug-related crimes are categorized based on the type of substance involved (e.g., cannabis, methamphetamine), and the specific nature of the offence (e.g., trafficking, possession).File Name: LGA_Offences.xlsxData Tables and Columns
